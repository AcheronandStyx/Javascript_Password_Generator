# UMN Coding Bootcamp Week Three Challenge - Password Generator

A javascript program which allows the user to select the criteria for a password and then generators a random password based on the users input.

* The program prompts the user to provide the character length of the password and then validates the length is in the range of 8 to 128 characters.
* A seires of confirm dialog boxes allow the user to choose what character types must be included in the password. (lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters)
* If no character type is selected an alert is displayed informing the user of the requirement to select at least one character type. Then the password generation script runs again.
* A password meeting the users criteria is then generated and displayed in an alert dialog box.
